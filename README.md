## FAQ

### Is this a copycat of [ClashX](https://github.com/yichengchen/clashX) or [Clash for Windows](https://github.com/Fndroid/clash_for_windows_pkg)?

Not exactly. I've been using ClashX for several months and I like it. It's easy to use and nicely designed. But I also need a decent Clash client on my Ubuntu Desktop. And the interface must be easy enough for anyone to use because I don't want to teach my wife how to edit proxy rules or how to use remote configuration files. So I decide to make my own Clash GUI client. I did NOT take any code or assets from those two projects but they did give me some ideas about interface design and implementation.

### I don't like Electron.
Me either.

### How can I check `Clash`'s logs in `Clashy` ?
You can't for now. Visit `127.0.0.1:2390/logs` for Clash logs.
